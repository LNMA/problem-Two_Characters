# problem-Two_Characters

1-Review:

In this challenge, you will be given a string. You must remove characters until the string is made up of any two alternating characters. When you choose a character to remove, all instances of that character must be removed. Your goal is to create the longest string possible that contains just two alternating letters.

As an example, consider the string abaacdabd. If you delete the character a, you will be left with the string bcdbd. Now, removing the character c leaves you with a valid string bdbd having a length of 4. Removing either b or d at any point would not result in a valid string.

Given a string (s), convert it to the longest possible string (t) made up only of alternating characters. Print the length of string (t) on a new line. If no string (t) can be formed 0 print instead.

2-Input Format:

The first line contains string (s). 

3-Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum length of (t) for the given (s) if it is not possible to form string (t) print 0 instead.

Ex:

1-input

    beabeefeab
    
2-output

    bebeeeb
    eaeeea
